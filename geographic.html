                <h2>Geographic Location Reviews</h2>
                <p>
                Depending on the category or subset of geographic location, I will be reviewing
                what kind of things are there to do in that location, the overall looks, the surrounding
                areas, etc.

                <h3>Chicago, IL, U.S.A.</h3>

                    Chicago is my hometown and will obviously hold a special place in my heart. I will not try
                    to be bias. Chicago is a very big city that has variety of neighborhoods with different cultures,
                    which I love because everywhere you go is a unique community.<br>
                    I'm a big city guy, so I happen to
                    like that there a lot of things available for me to use in the city: a big public transit system,
                    stores and restaurants everywhere, and many parks. Compared to New York, it's way less dense and cheaper while
                    still having "big city" things. And if you ever plan on visiting Chicago, we have the best tacos and
                    native restaurants like Portillos. I give Chicago a <span class="bold">5 out of 5 stars</span>.

                <h3>Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A.</h3>
                <div class="desc">
                    <img src="pittsburgh.png" alt="Aerial Shot of Pittsburgh" height="200" width="200"></img>
                    <p>
                    Pittsburgh is the city that I've resided for the second longest time, below Chicago of course. I came
                    here to attend at Carnegie Mellon University to study Physics (recently graduated in 2022). I've a lot of memories.

                    At first, I absolutely did not like Pittsburgh because it was so much smaller than Chicago. They have similar
                    architecture, feel, and weather, but it's smaller version of Chicago. It doesn't have a lively downtown area, as
                    it is only office buildings, nothing commercial. Finding authentic Mexican restaurants/stores was a pain as there are only
                    a couple locations that offer anything Mexican.<br>
                    
                    But now, I miss Pittsburgh. I would rather stay in Chicago, but I miss it. Maybe it's just missing the good old college days,
                    but there were certain vibes about it that made it unique. I was around my campus and other school campuses for the most part, so my perception
                    of Pittsburgh is skewed. If you wanted the energetic nightlife, there was certain neighborhood full of places to go at
                    night. If you wanted the chill nightlife, just being outdoors in the not-so populated city would give you that feeling.
                    I give Pittsburgh a <span class="bold">4 out of 5 stars</span>.
